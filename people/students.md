His research focuses on understanding how the human brain represents, processes, and regulates pain and emotions. His recent research focuses on understanding the distinct neural mechanisms underlying different pain modulation strategies such as placebo, distraction, reappraisal, and acceptance. He received his dual PhD in the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/">Department of Psychology and Neuroscience</a> and the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/ics/">Institute of Cognitive Sciences</a> from the University of Colorado Boulder (PhD advisor: <a href="http://wagerlab.colorado.edu/">Tor D. Wager</a>), and MA in Clinical psychology and BS in Biology from Seoul National University. He has received many awards including the <a href="http://www.iie.org/fulbright">Fulbright Graduate Study Award</a> from Korea and US governments, the Carol B. Lynch Graduate Fellowship from the graduate school of the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Heyer Award from the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience. Currently, he is an assistant professor at the IBS Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research and the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). </span>

Catherine is a postdoc in the Cocoan lab. She is currently interested in identifying neural markers associated with affective and cognitive constructs and developing a framework for psychological components. More broadly, she is interested in how people’s affective processing influences decision making, and the ways in which people regulate their emotions and stress. She received her Ph.D. in Psychology from Rutgers University-Newark (advisor: Mauricio Delgado), where her dissertation work focused on the effects of perceived controllability on decision making and affective processing. She also graduated from the Psychology program at Smith College (B.A.) and the Educational Psychology program from Korea University (M.A.) (advisors: Sung-il Kim and Mimi Bong).</span>
