<b><span style="font-size: 25px !important; color: #BD0026;">Core machine intelligence algorithms</span></b>


#### Neural network based denoising / estimation  
We apply deep neural networks to the classical denoising and estimation problems in signal processing. Under the universal denoising setting, only with 
the assumption of known noise model,



#### Multi-task reinforcement learning / continual learning  
#### External knowledge based reasoning  
#### Interpretable machine learning algorithms

#### Satellite data based PM2.5 level estimation
#### Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)
#### DNA seqeunce denoising
#### Neuroscience / Medical data analyses
