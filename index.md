Welcome! Our mission is to develop state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning algorithms for solving **intelligence** and **real world data problem**. 
For the **core algorithm research**, we currently focus on multi-task reinforcement learning, neural-network based estimation, interpretable machine learning, and external memory/knowledge based reasoning. For the **data science application research**, we work on non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), satellite-based PM 2.5 estimation, medical/neuroscience data analyses, DNA sequence denoising, and radar-based object recognition. For more information on reserach topics, please visit our [project page](projects/project).

Following is our Lab introducing video!
