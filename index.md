Welcome to M.IN.D Lab at School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University. We develop state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for solving **intelligence** and **real world data problem**. 

For the **core algorithm research**, we currently focus on multi-task reinforcement learning, neural-network based estimation, interpretable machine learning, and external memory/knowledge based reasoning. For the **data science application research**, we work on non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), satellite-based PM 2.5 estimation, medical/neuroscience data analyses, DNA sequence denoising, and radar-based object recognition.
