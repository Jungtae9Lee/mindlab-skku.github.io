We develop state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for solving **intelligence** and **real world data problem**. 

Our current main focus on **core algorithms** is on reinforcement learning, neural-network based denoising, interpretable machine learning, and external memory/knowledge based reasoning. 

For **data science problems**, we work on energy disaggregation, satellite-based PM2.5 estimation, medical/neuroscience data analyses, DNA sequence denoising, and radar-based object recognition.
